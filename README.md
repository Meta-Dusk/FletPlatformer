# FletPlatformer Game

An attempt at making a real-time (such as combat) game in Flet.
As of now, I've included various buttons for testing some functionality that I have already implemented in the game.

## Feature List

| Feature | Description | Version Implemented |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| **Background Panning** | The background pans to the right or left if the player is at the edge of the screen. | v0.2.X |
| **Simple Enemy AI** | The current enemy (goblin) has this. | v0.3.X |
| **Various Entity States** | Entities such as the player and the goblin, can die, move, attack, etc. | v0.3.X |
| **Sounds** | There's music and various SFX implemented | v0.1.X |

## Controls

The player can be controlled with the following mapped keys:

| Key | Action |
| --- | ------ |
| **A** | Move left. |
| **D** | Move right. |
| **Space** | Jump. |
